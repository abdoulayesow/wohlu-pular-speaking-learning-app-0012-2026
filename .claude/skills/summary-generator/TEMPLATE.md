# Session Summary Templates

Two tiers: **Lean** for short/narrow sessions, **Full** for substantial work.

---

## Lean Template

For commits, config changes, quick fixes, single bug fixes.

```markdown
# Session Summary: [FEATURE_NAME]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
**Session Focus:** [one-line description]

## Completed Work

- [bullet]
- [bullet]

## Key Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `path/to/file.ts` | [brief description] |

## Current State

[git status: what's committed vs pending, branch state]

## Next Steps

1. [next task]
2. [following task]

## Mistakes & Learnings

[Only if there were failed commands, retries, or avoidable mistakes]

- **[mistake]** → Fix: [what worked]. Saved to memory: [yes/no]

## Resume Prompt

` ` `
Resume [FEATURE_NAME] session.

## Context
Previous session completed:
- [key accomplishment 1]
- [key accomplishment 2]

Session summary: .claude/summaries/YYYY-MM-DD/YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM_feature-name.md

## Key Files to Review First
- path/to/main/file.tsx (primary changes)

## Current Status
[brief status]

## Next Steps
1. [immediate next task]
2. [following task]
` ` `
```

## Design Patterns Used

- **[Pattern Name]**: [how applied and why]

## Plan Progress

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Task 1 | **COMPLETED** | [notes] |

## Current Status
[brief status statement]

## Next Steps
1. [immediate next task]
2. [following task]
3. [third task]

## Template Tips

1. **Feature Name**: Use kebab-case for the filename (e.g., `lesson-flow-implementation`)
2. **Completed Work**: Group by category for easier scanning
3. **Files Table**: Include only files with significant changes
4. **Resume Prompt**: Make it copy-paste ready for the next session
5. **Retrospective**: Be honest — don't fabricate metrics you can't measure
