# Wohlu — User Persona: The Cultural Parent & The Heritage Child

**Document Version:** 2.0
**Date:** February 25, 2026
**Author:** Ablo (Product Owner)
**Status:** Draft — Pending Founder Review
**Predecessor:** 01 — Product Vision (to be updated for Segment 2 pivot)
**Pivot Note:** This document replaces the original Reconnector-first persona following a strategic pivot based on stronger demand signals from the Parent + Child segment.

## Dual Persona Model

Wohlu's MVP serves two people in one product:

- **The Cultural Parent** — the buyer, decision-maker, and co-learning facilitator
- **The Heritage Child** — the primary learner and daily user

These two personas are inseparable. The parent chooses, pays for, and guides the experience. The child engages with the content. The product must satisfy both — the parent's need for trust, security, and visible progress, and the child's need for engagement, warmth, and accomplishment.

### Backstory

Ibrahima came to the United States in 2009 with a computer science degree from Conakry and a determination to build a better life for his future family. He settled in Houston, where a growing Guinean community gave him a foothold. He married Fatoumata in 2013 — she'd grown up in Labé and came to the US through a family connection.

At home, Ibrahima and Fatoumata speak Pular to each other instinctively. It's the language of their intimacy, their arguments, their prayers, their humor. When they call family in Guinea, it's Pular. When they gather with other Guinean families in Houston for Eid or naming ceremonies, the adults speak Pular.

But their children speak English.

It happened gradually. Amadou started school and came home speaking English. Ibrahima and Fatoumata responded in Pular, but Amadou answered in English. The pattern repeated with Aissatou. By the time Oumar was born, the household had shifted — parents speak Pular to each other, English to the children, and the children speak only English. Fatoumata occasionally insists on Pular at the dinner table, but it never sticks for more than a few days.

Ibrahima feels this loss acutely. His mother in Mamou asks why the grandchildren can't speak to her on the phone. His siblings tease him — "You've become American." At the mosque, he sees other Guinean fathers struggling with the same problem. Everyone talks about it. Nobody has a solution.

He has tried:

- **Speaking only Pular at home for a week.** The children got frustrated, couldn't express themselves, and Fatoumata broke first because the kids needed help with homework.
- **Bringing his mother to Houston for three months.** This worked — Aissatou started understanding basic phrases. But his mother went home, and without daily reinforcement, it faded within weeks.
- **YouTube videos.** Found a couple of channels with children's songs in Pular. His kids watched once and said, "This is boring." The production quality was poor and the content felt disconnected from their American lives.
- **Teaching them himself on weekends.** He'd sit with Amadou and Aissatou and try to teach phrases. But he's not a teacher. He doesn't know where to start, how to structure it, or how to make it engaging. After a few weeks, weekend Pular lessons died quietly.

Ibrahima doesn't just want his children to learn vocabulary. He wants them to understand the culture — the respect embedded in greetings, the proverbs that carry wisdom, the way language shapes identity. He's afraid that if his children can't speak Pular, they'll grow up disconnected from their Fulani identity entirely. And that fear grows every year as they get more American and less Guinean.

### Goals

#### Primary Goal
**Find a structured, engaging way for his children to learn conversational Pular that he can facilitate at home, consistently, without being a language teacher himself.**

He needs the product to do the heavy lifting — structure the curriculum, provide native audio, make it engaging for children — while he sits beside them, guides, encourages, and adds his own cultural knowledge.

#### Secondary Goals

- **Give his children the ability to speak with grandparents in Guinea.** This is the most emotionally urgent goal. His mother is aging. He wants his children to have real conversations with her before it's too late.
- **Preserve Fulani identity across generations.** Language is the carrier of culture. Without it, he fears his children will be Fulani in name only.
- **Feel like he's doing his duty as a parent.** In Fulani culture, passing down language and values is a parental responsibility. His inability to do this effectively weighs on him.
- **Connect with other Guinean parents doing the same thing.** He wants to know he's not alone and to share what works.

---

### Frustrations and Pain Points

#### With the current situation

- **"There's nothing out there for Pular."** He's looked. Duolingo has Swahili. Apps exist for Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa. But Pular — a language spoken by 40 million people — has nothing structured for learners.
- **"I'm not a teacher."** He speaks Pular perfectly but has no idea how to teach it systematically to a child who thinks in English. He starts with random words, has no progression plan, and can't make it fun.
- **"My kids lose interest in two days."** Whatever he tries, the children disengage quickly. They associate Pular learning with their dad being frustrated, not with fun.
- **"Other parents have the same problem."** Every Guinean family he knows in Houston struggles with this. It's a constant topic at community gatherings. Everyone agrees it's a problem. Nobody has a solution.
- **"Bringing family from Guinea isn't sustainable."** It works but it's expensive, visa processes are difficult, and the effects fade when the visitor leaves.

#### With potential solutions

- **Security is paramount.** He will not install an app on his child's device that uses the camera, collects personal data about his children, or exposes them to unmoderated social features. Privacy and safety are non-negotiable.
- **Quality concerns.** The few African language resources he's found look cheap and unfinished. He won't invest time in something that feels unreliable.
- **Cultural accuracy matters.** If the Pular isn't right — wrong dialect, wrong tone, wrong cultural framing — he'll reject it. He knows the language. He'll notice errors instantly.
- **Consistency is the real challenge.** Even with a good tool, maintaining daily or weekly practice with his children requires structure and habit. The tool needs to support that consistency, not just provide content.

### Buyer Behavior

| Factor | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Decision trigger** | Seeing his children unable to communicate with family in Guinea; community conversations about language loss; finding a credible Pular resource for the first time |
| **Research process** | App Store search, word-of-mouth from other Guinean parents, WhatsApp group recommendations, mosque community referrals |
| **Willingness to pay** | High — already spends on children's education (tutoring, Quran classes, extracurriculars). Would pay $10-15/month without hesitation if the product is credible and effective |
| **Trust signals** | Built by native Pular speakers; no camera access; clear privacy policy; cultural accuracy; professional design quality; recommendations from other Guinean parents he knows |
| **Deal breakers** | Camera access required; child data collection; poor audio quality; wrong dialect or cultural errors; childish/patronizing tone for himself as the facilitator |

### Key Quotes (Composites from User Research)

> "I speak Pular every day. But I can't teach it. Those are two different things."

> "My mother asks me why the grandchildren can't speak. I don't have a good answer."

> "If something exists that teaches my kids Pular properly, I'll pay for it. Whatever it costs."

> "I need it to be safe. No camera. No tracking my kids. I need to trust it."

> "At every Guinean gathering, we talk about this problem. Every single one."

# Persona B: The Heritage Child

## Aissatou Bah

**"I want to understand what Neene and Baaba are saying."**

*(Neene = Mom, Baaba = Dad in Pular)*

---

### Demographics

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Name** | Aissatou Bah |
| **Age** | 7 |
| **Location** | Houston, Texas |
| **School** | 2nd grade at a public elementary school |
| **Languages spoken** | English (native and dominant); understands isolated Pular words (greetings, family terms, food names, a few commands) |
| **Interests** | Drawing, Roblox, watching YouTube Kids, playing with her older brother, helping her mom cook |
| **Tech access** | Uses a family iPad (supervised, limited apps); does not have her own phone |
| **Learning environment** | Does homework with parents, attends weekend Quran school |

---

### Backstory

Aissatou was born in Houston. She's never been to Guinea but has seen pictures and video calls with her grandmother — a woman she calls "Nene" who smiles a lot and speaks words Aissatou only partly understands.

Aissatou knows she's Guinean. She knows she's Fulani. She eats her mom's food, she wears the outfits her aunt sends from Labé during Eid, and she's proud when her dad tells stories about growing up in Mamou. But Pular is her parents' language, not hers. She exists in it the way a child exists in a room where adults are having their own conversation — present, aware, but not participating.

She picks up fragments. She knows "Jam waali" and "On walli" without understanding the grammar. She knows "nyaamu" means eat. She knows when her mom is calling her versus scolding her by tone alone. She recognizes the sound of Pular the way you recognize a song you've heard many times but never learned the words to.

When her dad tried to teach her Pular on weekends, she liked the attention but didn't like the method. He'd say a word, she'd repeat it, he'd say another word. It felt like being quizzed, not like learning. She couldn't see the point — she speaks English, everyone at home speaks English to her, and her world runs on English. Pular felt like an extra chore.

But she remembers the time her grandmother visited and her grandmother sang to her in Pular. She didn't understand all the words, but she loved it. She asks her mom to sing those songs sometimes. There's something in the sound of Pular that feels like home to her, even if she can't articulate it.

### Safety and Privacy Requirements

These are non-negotiable product requirements driven by the parent's concerns and the child's vulnerability:

| Requirement | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **No camera access** | The app must never request camera permissions. Period. No photo features, no video, no AR. |
| **No microphone required** | Microphone access for pronunciation practice is optional and parent-controlled, never mandatory. Listening-first by default. |
| **No child data collection** | Account is created by the parent with the parent's information. No name, age, photo, or personal data collected from the child. |
| **No social features** | No chat, no forums, no user-generated content visible to the child. No contact with other users. |
| **No ads** | No advertising of any kind within the app. |
| **No external links** | No links that take the child outside the app to browsers or other apps. |
| **Parental control** | Parent sets up the account, controls settings, and can view progress. The child cannot modify account settings. |
| **COPPA awareness** | While the account holder is the parent (not the child), the product is designed with COPPA principles in mind to ensure maximum protection. |
| **Offline capability** | Content can be downloaded for offline use — no requirement for always-on internet, reducing data exposure. |

# The Parent-Child Learning Dynamic

## How They Use Wohlu Together

Wohlu is not a "hand the kid the iPad and walk away" product. It's designed for **guided co-learning** — the parent and child sit together, typically for 10-15 minutes, and move through a lesson together.

### A Typical Session

**Setting:** After dinner, before bedtime. Ibrahima and Aissatou sit on the couch with the family iPad.

**1. Lesson Introduction (1-2 minutes)**
A situation card appears — an illustration of a Fulani family at the dinner table. The app introduces the context in English: "In Fulani families, meals are shared from a common bowl. Before eating, you say..."

**2. Listen and Learn (3-4 minutes)**
The app plays a Pular phrase with native pronunciation. English meaning is displayed. A cultural context note appears briefly. Aissatou listens. The app plays it again. Ibrahima says it alongside the audio — he becomes part of the lesson, not a spectator.

**3. Practice Together (3-4 minutes)**
The app prompts Aissatou to pick the right phrase for a situation (tap-based, not typing). Multiple-choice matching. Drag phrases to situations. Each correct answer gets a warm visual reward. Ibrahima helps and encourages.

**4. Cultural Moment (1-2 minutes)**
A brief cultural card — a proverb, a custom, a short story. Read together. Ibrahima adds his own commentary: "Your grandmother used to say this every evening." This is where the app creates space for the parent's own knowledge.

**5. Session Complete (30 seconds)**
Progress indicator updates. A star or badge earned. A preview of tomorrow's lesson to build anticipation. Total time: 8-12 minutes.

### The Parent's Role

The parent is not the teacher — **the app is the teacher, the parent is the guide.** This distinction is critical. Ibrahima doesn't need to know pedagogy. He needs to sit beside his daughter, press play, encourage her, and add his own stories when the app creates space for them. The app provides the structure he couldn't create on his own.

### Progress Visibility

The parent can view a simple dashboard showing:

- Lessons completed this week
- Phrases learned (cumulative)
- Current module and progress
- Streak (days of consecutive practice)
- No grades, no scores, no rankings — progress is about consistency and growth, not performance

# How the Reconnector Still Fits

The Reconnector (Mariama, age 23) is not abandoned by this pivot. The core content — situational Pular lessons with native audio and cultural context — serves both segments. The difference is in the wrapper:

| Feature | Parent + Child (MVP) | Reconnector (Phase 2) |
|---|---|---|
| Learning mode | Guided co-learning (parent + child) | Self-directed individual |
| Session length | 8-12 minutes | 5-15 minutes |
| Interaction style | Tap, match, listen (child-friendly) | Tap, match, listen, type, record |
| Cultural context | Brief, family-oriented | Deeper, identity-oriented |
| Progress tracking | Parent dashboard | Personal dashboard |
| Social sharing | Not applicable | Shareable progress cards |
| Account holder | Parent | Individual |
| Monetization | Subscription (parent pays) | Freemium (individual pays) |

**The content is the same. The experience is layered differently.** By building for the parent-child use case first, you create the content foundation that the Reconnector experience builds on later.

## Anti-Personas: Who We Are NOT Designing For

- **Not a standalone children's app.** We are not competing with ABCmouse or Khan Academy Kids. Wohlu requires parental involvement.
- **Not for first-generation adults who already speak Pular.** The parent already speaks it — the product teaches their child, not them.
- **Not a general Fulani cultural education platform.** Culture is the vehicle, language is the product. We don't teach history or geography — we teach how to speak.
- **Not a school curriculum tool (yet).** Designed for home use, not classroom adoption. Institutional use may come later.
- **Not for non-Fulani families.** The cultural specificity is a feature, not a limitation. We're not trying to be a generic African language app.
