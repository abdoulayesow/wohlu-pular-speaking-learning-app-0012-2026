# Wohlu — Product Vision

**Document Version:** 1.0

**Status:** Draft — Pending Founder Review

## Product Vision Statement

**For** Guinean-American families who want their children to speak Pular,
**who** see their heritage language slipping away with each generation,
**Wohlu** is a mobile language learning experience
**that** teaches conversational Pular through parent-guided, culturally immersive, situation-based lessons rooted in Guinean Fulani life.
**Unlike** generic African language platforms that spread thin across dozens of languages, or basic Adlam alphabet apps that teach script without conversation,
**our product** goes deep on Pular with native-speaker accuracy, cultural context from Fouta Djallon, and a family-centered design where parents guide their children through lessons they do together — safely, with no camera, no ads, and no child data collection.

## The Problem We're Solving

An estimated 10,000–30,000 second-generation Fulani-heritage people in the United States grew up hearing Pular spoken around them but never learned to speak it themselves. They experience a persistent cultural gap — unable to fully participate in family gatherings, ceremonies, or conversations with elders. This gap often deepens with age as grandparents pass and cultural anchors weaken.

Today, there is no adequate solution for these individuals:

- **No structured Pular learning app exists.** Duolingo, Babbel, and Rosetta Stone do not offer Pular. Nkenne and Lingawa focus on Igbo, Yoruba, and Swahili. Izesan! lists Fulfulde but lacks depth and struggles with monetization.
- **Adlam script apps teach the alphabet, not the language.** They serve a different audience — primarily first-generation speakers learning to read/write, not second-generation learners who need to understand and speak.
- **YouTube content is mediocre and unstructured.** Limited to a few children's shows with singing — not designed for adult or teen heritage learners.
- **The current workaround is social and expensive.** Families bring relatives from Guinea who don't speak English, forcing immersion. This is effective but unsustainable and inaccessible for most families.

The result: a generation of Fulani Americans who want to connect with their heritage language but have no accessible, engaging path to do so.

## Target User — The Cultural Parent & The Heritage Child

Our MVP targets a **dual-user segment: the parent-child pair.**

**The Cultural Parent (Buyer & Guide):**
- Ages 30–50
- First-generation Guinean immigrant; speaks Pular natively
- Wants their American-born children to learn Pular but lacks the tools and teaching structure
- Willing to pay for their children's cultural education
- Demands privacy and security — no camera, no child data collection, no ads
- Already spends on children's education (tutoring, Quran school, extracurriculars)

**The Heritage Child (Primary Learner):**
- Ages 5–12
- Born in the United States; speaks English as dominant language
- Understands isolated Pular words passively but cannot speak
- Needs engaging, audio-first, visually warm learning experiences
- Learns best in short sessions (10 minutes) with parental involvement

**The Reconnector** (second-generation young adults, ages 16–28) represents a strong secondary segment. The same content serves them with a different experience wrapper — self-directed rather than parent-guided. This segment enters in Phase 2.

## Core Value Proposition

**Wohlu is the first language app that lets Guinean families pass Pular to the next generation.**

It doesn't teach Pular like a foreign language course. It teaches it like a family tradition — organized around the real situations where language and culture intersect: greeting elders properly, understanding conversation at a naming ceremony, sharing a meal together, expressing respect in the way a grandmother would recognize. Parents sit beside their children, guiding 10-minute sessions where the app provides the structure and the parent provides the heart.

Every lesson includes:

- **Native pronunciation** from real Pular speakers (not synthesized audio)
- **Cultural context** explaining not just what to say, but why, when, and to whom
- **Situation-based learning** organized by life moments, not grammar textbooks
- **Family-centered design** where the app teaches and the parent guides
- **Absolute privacy** — no camera, no microphone requirement, no child data, no ads

## Strategic Positioning

### What We Are

- A depth-first Pular learning experience — the best in the world for this language
- Culturally anchored in Guinean Fulani (Fouta Djallon) identity and traditions
- Audio-first, mobile-first, designed for bite-sized daily practice
- Built by native Pular speakers with personal stakes in the mission

### What We Are Not

- A multi-language platform (not yet)
- A translation tool (not a dictionary or Google Translate competitor)
- An Adlam literacy app (though Adlam may become an optional module)
- A children's app or parental teaching tool (in the MVP)

### Competitive Moat

1. **Linguistic authenticity** — Founded by native Pular speakers from Guinea with deep cultural knowledge
2. **Cultural specificity** — Content is rooted in Fouta Djallon Fulani life, not generic pan-African content
3. **Community distribution** — Direct access to Guinean diaspora networks (mosques, WhatsApp groups, cultural organizations) in key US markets (NYC, Houston, DMV, Atlanta)
4. **First mover in Pular depth** — No competitor offers structured, immersive Pular learning. By going deep on one language, we build a position that broad platforms can't easily replicate.

## Design Principles

1. **Family over solo.** Wohlu is designed for parent and child together. The app teaches, the parent guides. This is the product's core differentiator.
2. **Belonging over proficiency.** The goal is "my child feels Fulani," not "my child scored B2." Design for emotional and cultural outcomes.
3. **Situation over grammar.** Organize learning around life moments, not linguistic concepts. Grammar is embedded, not taught abstractly.
4. **Pronunciation is the product.** In Pular culture, how you say something — tone, respect markers, proper greetings — matters enormously. Audio quality is non-negotiable.
5. **Never make the child feel stupid.** These children are learning what they feel they "should" already know. Every interaction must feel encouraging, never condescending.
6. **Culture is the hook, language is the vehicle.** Cultural context (proverbs, ceremonies, customs, humor) keeps families engaged when the learning gets hard.
7. **Privacy is sacred.** No camera, no mic requirement, no child data, no ads. This is a promise, not a feature. Parents must trust Wohlu completely.
8. **Design for the burst.** Family motivation comes in waves. Make the first session magical. Make returning after a gap feel welcoming, not punishing.

## Business Model Hypothesis

### Primary Revenue: Freemium Subscription

- **Free tier:** First learning module (Greetings & Respect) with full audio and cultural context — enough to deliver a meaningful experience and demonstrate value
- **Paid tier ($7.99–9.99/month):** All learning modules, spaced repetition, progress tracking, and cultural deep-dives
- **Annual plan ($59.99–79.99/year):** Standard discount for annual commitment

### Secondary Revenue (Future)

- Community tutoring marketplace (connecting learners with native speakers)
- Cultural content partnerships (Fulani storytellers, musicians, historians)
- Enterprise/institutional licensing (cultural organizations, universities, diaspora associations)

### Alternative Funding Streams to Explore

- Language preservation grants (UNESCO, NEA, Ford Foundation, Endangered Languages Project)
- Cultural heritage grants targeting African diaspora communities
- Community crowdfunding through Guinean organizations

### Key Assumption

At least 5% of the addressable market (10,000–30,000 users) will convert to paid subscriptions. At 500–1,500 paying subscribers at $6/month effective rate, the product generates $36K–$108K annual recurring revenue — sufficient for a sustainable lifestyle business with room to grow through adjacent languages and markets.

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Market too small for sustainable revenue | High | Medium | Validate with waitlist before building. Design for adjacent market expansion. Explore grant funding. |
| Low retention after initial enthusiasm | High | High | Design for "burst" motivation patterns. Make returning after a gap easy. Cultural content as engagement hook. |
| Content production bottleneck | Medium | Medium | Founder and family produce MVP content. AI tools for structuring and formatting. Community contributors for expansion. |
| Competitor adds Pular | Medium | Low | Depth beats breadth. Cultural specificity is hard to replicate. Community relationships create distribution moat. |
| Pular dialect fragmentation | Medium | Medium | Start with Fouta Djallon Pular. Architect content model for future dialect modules. |
| AI translation quality insufficient for Pular | Low | High | Do not depend on AI for core linguistic content. All phrases human-created and verified. AI used for workflow only. |
